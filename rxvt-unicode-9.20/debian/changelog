  * New upstream release:
    - Cleans up eaves zombie shell processes in urxvtd (Closes: #339833)

      world-readable and world-writable (likely in original rxvt, too), and were
      not restored properly. Affected are only systems where non-unix ptys were
      used (such as most BSDs, not GNU/Linux). (found, patched and debugged by
      Ryan Beasley).
    + From upstream changelog: - meta8 support was forcefully enabled in most
      configurations.  restored configurability of this (useless) feature
      (reported by Mikachu). (closes: #346150, reopen if it doesn't)
